1: All players Start with 0 points. It is not possible to get less

2: All players roll a die simultainiously. The size of the die is one side bigger than the number of players.
	Example: there is 4 players, so the dice the players roll has 5 sides, from 1-5
	
3: Whoever rolls the highest number, gets 1 one point.
	Example: Player 3 rolls the only 5, so he gets 1 point.
	
4: If 2 or more players rolls highest, they all lose 1 point.
